BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF TOILET PAPER ROLLS ARE USED PER YEAR!  EACH ROLL PRODUCES ONE CARDBOARD TUBE, PRETTY MUCH IDENTICAL TO ALL THE OTHER ONES!  WE ARE SEIZING THIS WASTE STREAM AND TURNING IT INTO MEDIA!  THESE TUBES ARE ALL HYPERLINKS TO SERVERS FROM THE TRASH, WHILE THEY ARE THEMSELVES TRASH!  THIS MAKES THEM HYPERTRASH!  IN PARTICULAR, THEY ARE THE TRASH MAGIC HYPERTUBE NETWORK!

WE ARE LOOKING FOR TRASH MAGIC NETWORK OPERATORS TO TAKE OLD SERVERS AND PUT TRASH MAGIC ON THEM AND AND USE THEM TO SPREAD THE ALBUM IN PHYSICAL SPACES OVER LOCAL WIFI NETWORKS!  WE ARE LOOKING FOR TRASH MAGICIANS TO SPREAD HPYERTUBES BY COLLECTING TOILET PAPER CARDBOARD TUBES AND PUTTING MEMES AND LINKS ON THEM AND RELEASING THEM OUT INTO PHYSICAL NETWORKS!
